Question We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).
(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)

Solution â€“ 
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], K: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        result = sorted(points,key = lambda x: x[0]**2 + x[1]**2)
        
        return result[:K]
