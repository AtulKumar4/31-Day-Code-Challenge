Question - Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.
Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.
Note:
You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

Solution -  
 def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        for i in ransomNote:
            if i not in magazine:
                return False
            magazine = magazine.replace(i,"",1)
        return True
