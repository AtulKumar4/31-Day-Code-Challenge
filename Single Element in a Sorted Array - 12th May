Question  - You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Solution â€“ 1

def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(set(nums)) *2 - sum(nums)
        
Solution -2         
From collections import Counter
def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        occurance = Counter(nums)
        return min(occurance, key = occurance.get)
