Question - You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Ist Solution -  Fast solution in terms of exection time 

 def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int: 
     return sum([1  for char in S if char in set(list(J))])
				
2nd Solution - little slow compare to first solution

def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
  jewel = 0
	for i,char in enumerate(S):
		if char in J:
			jewel += 1
		return jewel
