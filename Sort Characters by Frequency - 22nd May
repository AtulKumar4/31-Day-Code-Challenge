Question  Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
Example 1:
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

Solution â€“ 
def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        counts = Counter(s)
        
        order = sorted(counts.items(),key = lambda x: x[1], reverse = True)

        return "".join([char *count for char,count in order]  )
