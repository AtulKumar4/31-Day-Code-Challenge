Question There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Solution â€“ 
def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        visit = [0 for _ in range(numCourses)]
        
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        
        for x,y in prerequisites:
            graph[x].append(y)
        
        def dfs(i):
            
            if visit[i] == -1:
                return False
            if visit[i] ==1:
                return True
            visit[i] = -1
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not (dfs(j)):
                    return True
            visit[i] = 1
            return True
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not (dfs(i)):
                return False
        return True
