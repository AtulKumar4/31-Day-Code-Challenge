Question - Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.
Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as sqrt.

Solution 1 -  
 def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int):
        guess= num
        while guess * guess > num:
            guess = (guess + num/guess) //2
        return guess * guess == num
Solution 2 â€“ 

def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int):
    
        return (num**0.5).is_integer()
