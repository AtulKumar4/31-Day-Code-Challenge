Question - Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠ n/2 âŒ‹ times.
You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Solution 1 -  
        def majorityElement(nums: List[int])
        nums.sort()
        return nums[(len(nums) // 2)]

Solution 2 -
    from collections import Counter
    def majorityElement(nums: List[int]):
        counts = Counter(nums)
        threshold = len(nums) // 2
        l =  [i for i in counts  if counts[i] > threshold]
        return l[0]
